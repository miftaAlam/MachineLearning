I have an outline of a possible tensorflow lite setup but I am getting nonsense.

Candidates to look at are:
  * is it OK to do the `astype` conversion?
  * am I really setting up the input tensor correctly?
  * I should use a model someone else tells me to use instead of those ones I grabbed just to make sure I can use their tute
